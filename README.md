# Docker_WebApplication
ğŸ“Œ In this I have to create a User Friendly Web Portal Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) 

ğŸ“ŒUsed Asynchronous Javascript to request server using API.

ğŸ“Œ This app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:
 
 ğŸ‘‰docker images
 ğŸ‘‰docker ps
 ğŸ‘‰docker run
 ğŸ‘‰docker rm -f
 ğŸ‘‰docker exec
 ğŸ‘‰ add more Linux Command.
